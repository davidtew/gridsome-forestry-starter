Disgusting, totally outrageous, and frankly wholly expected: 'In a move straight out of a tin-pot dictatorship, the Trump Administration has stopped responding to United Nations inquiries into human rights conditions. Last spring, the State Department quietly stopped responding to complaints filed by UN special rapporteurs investigating extreme poverty, family separations at the border, and attacks on freedom of the press. There are currently 13 outstanding requests for information.

This kind of behavior to prevent international scrutiny is to be expected from totalitarian regimes like North Korea, but not the United States of America. It is yet another example of how Trump has damaged America's reputation in the world.' - Robert Reich
