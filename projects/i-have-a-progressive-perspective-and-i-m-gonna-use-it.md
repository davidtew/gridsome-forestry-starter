**Progressivism** is the support for or [advocacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy "Advocacy") of improvement of society by [reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_reform "Social reform").[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism#cite_note-1) As a [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), it is based on the [idea of progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea_of_progress "Idea of progress"), which asserts that advancements in [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"), [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology"), [economic development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development "Economic development") and [social organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_organization "Social organization") are vital to the improvement of the [human condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_condition "Human condition").

The meanings of progressivism have varied over time and from different perspectives. Progressivism became highly significant during the [Age of Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment") in Europe, out of the belief that Europe was demonstrating that societies could progress in [civility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civility "Civility") from uncivilized conditions to civilization through strengthening the basis of [empirical knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence "Empirical evidence") as the foundation of society.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism#cite_note-Harold_Mah_1914._p157-2) Figures of the Enlightenment believed that progress had [universal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_(metaphysics) "Universal (metaphysics)") application to all societies and that these ideas would spread across the world from Europe.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism#cite_note-Harold_Mah_1914._p157-2)

The contemporary common political conception of progressivism in the [culture of the Western world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture "Western culture") emerged from the vast [social changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_change "Social change") brought about by [industrialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialization "Industrialization") in the Western world in the late-19th century. Progressives in the early-20th century took the view that progress was being stifled by vast [economic inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality "Economic inequality") between the rich and the poor; minimally regulated [_laissez-faire_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire "Laissez-faire") [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism") with [monopolistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly "Monopoly") [corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation "Corporation"); and intense and often violent conflict between workers and capitalists, thus claiming that measures were needed to address these problems.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism#cite_note-3) Early-20th century progressivism was also tied to [eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics "Eugenics")[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism#cite_note-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism#cite_note-5)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism#cite_note-6)and the [temperance movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperance_movement "Temperance movement").[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism#cite_note-7)[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism#cite_note-8) Contemporary progressives promote [public policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policies "Public policies") that they believe will lead to positive social change.
